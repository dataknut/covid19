Inevitably, a place to look at covid19 data. 

Best viewed at

 * USA [deaths](usaDeaths.html) - using https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/mortality.html
 * UK deaths - ideally using https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales but there is one xl per year!!
